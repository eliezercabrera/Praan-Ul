#Praan Ul

**Praan Ul** is a mod for the 2011 videogame, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.

The mods improved upon the death sequence when the player character dies. The mod is meant to be used with another mod that prevents the camera from going to third person when the player dies.

Praan Ul does a few things, including fading the screen to black and fading sound into silence when the player dies from barely lethal blows, or blacks out immediately if the player dies from a devastating blow.

Current development focuses in adding the ability to configure the mod through a GUI interface in-game, leveraging the third-party mod/framework SkyUI. The development branch has already implemented some of these settings, which are detailed in the commit history.

###Planned Features for 2.0 Release:

* Add an MCM for the mod

* Mute music toggle

* Enable/disable the mod

* Customizable visual effects: regular vision / blurry vision, fade to black/white

* Independent audio loss: hearing is usually lost after sight

* Indefinite blank screen until player presses a specific key, or any key

* Enable/Disable heartbeat and red screen effect

* Enable/Disable blood drops on screen

* Apply exaggerated ragdoll physics fix (maybe)

* Cleanly uninstall mod; extend magical effect that can be dispelled for safe uninstallation
